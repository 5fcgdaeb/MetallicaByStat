Metallica came up with this idea where fans have voted for the shows to be played in their worldwide concerts. They have named it Metallica by Request! More details are at https://www.metallicabyrequest.com.

This app adds up and compiles the requested songs from every night and displays the totals. It also has some other cool statistics that are work-in-progress. It is built for fun and for the love of Metallica!
